### Surface 
 
#### Colour Scheme 

I wanted a simple colour scheme, so I went 3 colours white (#FFFFFF), black (#000000), and orange (#E19B74). 
 
Black and white was chosen to make it simple and the orange was chosen as it is the exact match of the photo on the homepage. 
 
![Colours](https://github.com/raniamarhoni/SheysSkinKitchen/blob/master/design/readme%20images/Colours.png)

#### Typography
 
I picked 2 fonts to be used one for headers and one for general text. 
 
The 2 fonts are Amatic SC for headers and Abel for general text. 
 
![Fonts](https://github.com/raniamarhoni/SheysSkinKitchen/blob/f193cf736e6e5acd551e30563e54f2d96578d157/design/readme%20images/Fonts.png)
 
#### Images
 
Other than the product images only 1 other image has been used on the homepage to give a warm welcome feel that colour scheme was based around this photo as the background was orange and therefor orange was added to the colour scheme.
 
It is of hands with cream on them representing what the site sells Skin care e.g., creams. 
 
### Skeleton 
 
Once all the pages have been chosen and a design accepted, I then went to design each page on Adobe XD see below all the wireframes for each page.

### Structure 
 
The navbar and footer has access to everything that the type of user will need. 

#### Data Tables 

All the data is stored in SQL and Django to manage the storage as well.

How the tables are designed are all shown below.

**Site users**

We used django-allauth for this to set up users therefore we have the details below:
1)	Username
2)	Password 
3)	First Name (We only get this when they make an order)
4)	Last Name (We only get this when they make an order)
5)	Email Address
6)	Last Login 
7)	Date Joined 
8)	Permissions 

*Categorys**

![Category Admin](https://github.com/raniamarhoni/SheysSkinKitchen/blob/571ea6291df15a3d8d01bd5a600446d3394a170e/design/readme%20images/Category_admin.JPG)

**Products**

**Product sizes and prices**

**Reviews**

**Purchases Made**

![Purchase Admin](https://github.com/raniamarhoni/SheysSkinKitchen/blob/571ea6291df15a3d8d01bd5a600446d3394a170e/design/readme%20images/Purchase%20Admin.JPG)

### Scope 


Once all the user stories have been complete all the features needed for the site to meet the user stories are detailed below. 

**User experiences edit profile and delivery details**

Each user can easily log in and out with no problems. If a user forgets their password, they can easily recover it with their email. They can also save their delivery address to save them time if there a frequent customer and do not want to write there address every time they make a purchase. 

**Payment Details saved no longer will be done**

While designing I wanted a user to save their card details to save time when purchasing items but was informed about the security risk and the various laws around it. As internet browsers now save those details, I thought it better it takes this out to avoid any security issues.

**Basket**

The total in the basket will always be shown in the navbar to let the shopper know how much is always in their basket.  

**Reviews**

Once a shopper has signed up and has purchased an item. They can leave a review for others to see and then once a new shopper has come to the site, they will then be able to see the reviews of the product and filter products on the best rated. 

**Checkout and Order confirmation**

When a shopper has purchased something, they will receive an email confirmation of what they have purchased and an order confirmation page which will detail what they have brought and all the information they have provided. So, shoppers will be able to have s record of what they have purchased. 

**Store owner to add, edit and delete a product**

The store owner will be able to add products to the store for shoppers to purchase. They can then edit the item in the future if they wish to put it on sale or add more stock for example and then delete the product of, they wish to no longer sell it. This is done by have form set up for them to allow this to happen. 
 
**Add multiple sizes and prices for a product** 

The store owner can save multiple sizes which will have different prices until each product. This is to avoid having the product save in twice under 2 products. This will make it easier to manage as the store owner can see everything associated with the product in one page when they add or edit. 

### Strategy 
 
My aim for this project is to build a website where all the user stories are met above. As a shopper, site user and store owner. Once I have outlined all the requirements, I will come up with a design scheme where I will make sure all wireframes made meet all the requirements of the user stories and design scheme. 

## Features
 
### Existing Features
#### Toast Messages 
Messages come up whenever it’s needed to let the user know what is ging on and to let them know if what they clicked worked like signing out. 

#### Django-allauth features
##### Verifying your email 
When signing up it was verifying your email to make sure it’s you. 
##### Forgot password
If a user forgets their password, they would be able to reset it by a email link
##### Logout
When a user logs out, they will be asked if they are sure and if clicked yes will give a toast message saying they logged out successfully. 

#### Back to Top button
Back to Top button allows a user to scroll up to the top of the page, that makes a navigation easier. This is only used in the products page as it’ll be the only page long enough that will need it 


### Features Left to Implement

#### Reviews to be only added by people who have ordered the product 
I would like for people who have purchased the product to be able to leave a review but at the moment anyone can leave a review on a product. 

#### Multiple Images for product 
This feature would let a product to have multiple images instead of just one. 

#### Sign in and up with Social media (Goggle and Facebook)
This feature would let people register or sign in with there social media which would make it a lot easier. 

#### Contact Page 
Due to time constraints, I didn’t have enough time to do a contact page as the site is not live and for educational purposes at the moment I thought I was better to leave it the way it is.

## Testing

### Validators 

### HTML

All the HTML files were tested through [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input). I Went onto Goggle Dev Tools to get the full html code with python to test the code. There were also few minor errors and warning that can be safely ignored. Apart from that, no other errors were found across the html pages.   

### CSS

All the CSS files were tested through [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

### JavaScript

All the JS files were tested through [Esprima](https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html) and [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) validators, code was syntactically valid. "$" was not defined by JSHint.    

### Python

All the Python files were tested through [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/) validator. 

## Compatibility and Responsiveness

This website had been being tested during the development across multiple browsers and on **multiple devices**: mobile, tablets and laptops.
Also, the following tools were used to constantly test the project:
Google Chrome's developer tools to see how it looks across all the different device screen sizes to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.       


### Django-allauth tests
I used django-allauth as it has all the features I need for the site and it is completely customizable and will allow me to add more functionality later and as it is an open source, so it is backed by millions of developers who keep it secure and up to date. 

While setting up allauth I ran some tests to make sure it works. 

**Checking I can log in and out. (1 test)**
As I created the superuser in the terminal I can check it works my adding ‘/admin’ to the page address when I open the project and see if I am able to log in using the superuser login I created in the terminal. 

**Verifying email tests (2 tests)**
1.  I went to setting. py and under the email set up in ‘LOGIN_REDIRECT_IRL = “/”’ I changed it to ‘LOGIN_REDIRECT_IRL = “/Success”’
2.  I opened the project and put ‘accounts/login’ at the end of the page address. 
3.  Signed in and if it says I must verify my email then it passed the first test(1st test checked)
4.  Then I went back and put ‘admin’ at the end of the page address making sure ‘accounts/login’ has been deleted from the page address.
5.  I Logged in and click email addresses. 
6.  Then I clicked on the email I put the superuser as and ticked verify and primary and saved. 
7.  I went back to ‘accounts/login’ at the end of the page address making sure ‘admin’ was gone and logged back in again.
8.  I logged in and if it says /success at the end of the page address it passed the second test (2nd test passed)
9.  I went back into setting. py and changed the code to ‘LOGIN_REDIRECT_IRL = “/”’. 

### Testing new templates or pages

Whenever creating a new page or template I would always check it works before writing any code by just putting a h1 header of ‘It works’ with bootstrap CSS on it of text-success where the text will come up green to make sure it works as the links are in the base template. 

### Responsive Design testing 
To check the code works on all screens. I used the inspect section of google chrome. Where I can change the screen size to see if the design will work on all screens. 

To go on the inspect section on google chrome I right clicked on the website and clicked on ‘Inspect’ then on the top left it then gives options to change the screen size. 

#### Bugs found in responsive design 

**Banner not on tablet or phone screens**

While testing the responsive design I found that the banner does not show on tablet or phone screens as it was behind the nav therefore I added padding to bring it down and made sure no padding was there when on large screens.  

**item would not add to bag**

When adding something to the bag the page was kept breaking and bringing up a 404 error. While investigating I noticed that when it was redirecting it did not have the product model connected as it needs to model’s to go back and therefore added it in for it to redirect probably.

## Deployment
This project was developed using the [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) online IDE and
using Git & GitHub for version control. It is hosted on the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) platform, with static files hosted in AWS S3 Basket.

### Local Deployment
To be able to run this project, the following tools have to be installed:
- An IDE of your choice (I used [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) for creating this project)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) 
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)    

Apart from that, you also need to create accounts with the following services:
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to setup the [S3 basket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)
- [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/)

#### Directions
1. You can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting the following command into the terminal:   
`git clone https://github.com/raniamarhoni/SheysSkinKitchen.git`    
Alternatively, you can save a copy of this repository by clicking the green button **Clone or download** , then **Download Zip** button, and after extract the Zip file to your folder.      
In the terminal window of your local IDE change the directory (CD) to the correct file location (directory that you have just created).       

Note: You can read more information about the cloning process on the [GitHub Help page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).   

2. Set up environment variables.     
Note, that this process will be different depending on IDE you use.   
In this it was done using the following way:      
    - Create `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory
    - In `.env` file set environment variables with the following syntax:     
    ```bash 
    import os  
    os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"    
    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Secret key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Public key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Secret key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "<Your Stripe WH_Secret key>"    
    os.environ["GOOGLE_MAP_KEY"] = "<Your Google Map key>" 
     ```
       
Read more about how to set up the Stripe keys in the [Stripe Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/keys)
    
3. Install all requirements from the **requirements.txt** file putting this command into your terminal:     
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`     
4. In the terminal in your IDE migrate the models to crete a database using the following commands:    
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`     
`python3 manage.py migrate`     
5. Load the data fixtures(**categories**, **products**, **itinerary**, **itinerary_items**, **events**) in that order into the database using the following command:    
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`        
6. Create a superuser to have an access to the the admin panel(you need to follow the instructions then and insert username,email and password):    
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`   
7. You will now be able to run the application using the following command:     
`python3 manage.py runserver`     
8. To access the admin panel, you can add the `/admin` path at the end of the url link and login using your superuser credentials.

### Heroku Deployment
*To start Heroku Deployment process, you need to clone the project as described in the [Local deployment](#local-deployment) section above.*     
To deploy the project to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) the following steps need to be completed:    
1. Create a **requirement.txt** file, which contains a list of the dependencies, using the following command in the terminal:    
`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`    
2. Create a **Procfile**, in order to tell Heroku how to run the project, using the following command in the terminal:      
`web: gunicorn sheysskinkitchen.wsgi:application`    
3. `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` these files to GitHub repository.     
NOTE: these 1-3 steps already done in this project and included in the GitHub repository, but illistrated here as they are required for the successfull deployment to Heroku.        
As well as that, other things that are required for the Heroku deployment and have to be installed: **gunicorn** (WSGI HTTP Server), **dj-database-url** for database connection and **Psycopg** (PostgreSQL driver for Python). All of the mentioned above are *already installed* in this project in the requirements.txt file.     
4. On the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) website you need to create a **new app**, assigne a name (must be unique),set a region to the closest to you(for my project I set Europe) and click **Create app**.   
5. Go to **Resources** tab in Heroku, then in the **Add-ons** search bar look for **Heorku Postgres**(you can type `postgres`), select **Hobby Dev — Free** and click **Provision** button to add it to your project.     
6. In Heroku **Settings** click on **Reveal Config Vars**.   
7. Set the following config variables there:     

| KEY            | VALUE         |
|----------------|---------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<your aws access key>`  |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<your aws secret access key>`  |
| DATABASE_URL| `<your postgres database url>`  |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<your email password(generated by Gmail)>` |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER| `<your email address>`  |
| SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY| `<your stripe public key>`  |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY| `<your stripe secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET| `<your stripe wh key>`  |
| USE_AWS | `True`  |
     
8. Copy **DATABASE_URL's value**(Postrgres database URL) from the Convig Vars and temporary paste it into the default database in **settings.py**.     
You can temporary comment out the current database settings code and just paste the following in the settings.py:   
```bash 
  DATABASES = {     
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<your Postrgres database URL here>")     
    }
  ```
Important Note: that's just temporary set up, this URL **should not be committed and published to GitHub** for security reasons, so make sure not to commit your changes to Git while the URL is in the settings.py.     
9. Migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the following commands in the terminal:    
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`     
`python3 manage.py migrate`     
10. Load the data fixtures(**categories**, **products**, **itinerary**, **itinerary_items**, **events**) into the  Postgres database using the following command:     
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`      
11. Create a **superuser** for the Postgres database by running the following command(*you need to follow the instructions and inserting username,email and password*):      
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`     
12. You need to remove your Postgres URL database from the settings and uncomment the default DATABASE settings code in the settings.py file.    
Note: for production you get the environment variable 'DATABASE_URL' from the Heroku Config Vars and use Postgress database, while for development you use the SQLite as a default database.     
13. Add your Heroku app URL to **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in the settings.py file.
14. You can connect Heroku to GitHub to automatically deploy each time you push to GitHub.    
To do so, from the Heroku dashboard follow the steps:
-  **Deploy** section -> **Deployment method** -> select **GitHub**
-  link the Heroku app to your GitHub repository for this project
- click **Enable Automatic Deploys** in the Automatic Deployment section
- Run `git push` command in the terminal, that would now push your code to both Github and Heroku, and perform the deployment.

##### Hosting media files with AWS
The **static files** and **media files** (that will be uploaded by superuser - product/service images) are hosted in the [AWS S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/). To host them, you need to create an account in AWS and create your S3 basket with *public access*. More about setting it up you can read in [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) and [this tutorial](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html).
